Not so early, Yandex company on yours conference is [YaC 2012](http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/ya-events/album/136128/) presented the [Yandex browser 1.0](http://browser.yandex.com/). Let's show it inside.

The engine of this thing is open source browser ```Chromium```. Some intresting, that Some sites detected that it's 19 version of google chrome, but at the moment of this post ```Google Chrome``` has 23.xxx version. String of search find in Yandex on default. So, already we have some Google and some Yandex. "Yeah.. Not enough Opera" - thinking guys from Yandex and added Turbo technology by Opera. It's mix equals to Yandex browser. Some people have a nick "Stringy" for the specific logo.

And we can see a mix of modern technology. Therefore, on my mind it's "discovered bicycle" (it is russian flying phrase). At the first time, we can't see new many features. Of all proposed [here](http://browser.yandex.com/), I would single out only the following:

* New view of URL. Now url will not so lenght. It's will be name of web page look like bread crumbs
* New menu of fast link - "Tableu". Favorite sites will only be a click away and colorful widgets will show you up-to-date information about the weather and traffic, as well as social network notifications.
* Smartbox - Enter your searches and websites into the Smartbox. Search suggestions will help you search more quickly and autocorrect errors.

And so on, I think that guys from Yandex must have hard working on th</span>is thing, and may be some version their have a fortune.
