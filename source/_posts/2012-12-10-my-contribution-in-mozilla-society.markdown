It's my first publication on english. And it's blog some training for my english. And so on, in this topic I'd like to tell about Mozilla society. And how I become in mozilla contribution list. For me it's very intresting to participate in some activities. But I'm not a mozilla evangelist. :) 

I think that not secret for each other that mozilla it's global web society where each people can have yours contribution: programming, design sites, translate article on [mozilla network](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/)

Site [what can I do for mozilla](http://whatcanidoformozilla.org/) help a new people who it's can intrested. If you like makes open source world better, that it's makes interested you. Some of yours can see page with title "Our Contributors" on menu "About Firefox" - "global society" in mozilla products. Perhaps you too would become on this page. It's very easy. There are some advice after this.

### What I can do?

Translate to russian some topics on [mozilla network](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/) or other resource of this society. If you are developer you can started for fix some minor bugs for Firefox, Thunderbird, and etc. After your review code you can get access to repository with more content. If you think that you makes some good things for society you can send letter to ```credits@mozilla.org``` giving your name, email address and a sentence (citation) summarizing your contribution. If it's true you have a lot of chance be on board contribution. And have mental pleasure :)
